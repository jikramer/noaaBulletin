THE COMBINATION OF LIGHT WINDS AND OCCASIONAL CLEAR SKIES HAS
ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO GET TO FREEZING IN SOME SPOTS. IN
ADDITION...WHILE MANY LOCATIONS ARE IN THE MID 30S...GROUND
TEMPERATURES ARE TYPICALLY COLDER. THESE TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH
MELTED SNOW FROM EARLIER TODAY...WILL ALLOW FOR THE FORMATION OF
PATCHY BLACK ICE ON AREA ROADWAYS AND SIDEWALKS.
BLACK ICE IS VERY HARD TO SEE...SO MOTORISTS AND PEDESTRIANS ARE
URGED TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN TRAVELING THIS EVENING.

THE COMBINATION OF LIGHT WINDS AND HIGH THIN CLOUDS HAS ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO GET TO FREEZING IN SOME SPOTS. IN ADDITION...WHILE
MANY LOCATIONS ARE IN THE MID 30S...GROUND TEMPERATURES ARE
TYPICALLY COLDER. THESE TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH MELTED SNOW FROM
EARLIER TODAY...WILL ALLOW FOR THE FORMATION OF PATCHY BLACK ICE
ON AREA ROADWAYS AND SIDEWALKS.
BLACK ICE IS VERY HARD TO SEE...SO MOTORISTS AND PEDESTRIANS ARE
URGED TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN TRAVELING THIS EVENING.
